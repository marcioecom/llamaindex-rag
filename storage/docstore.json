Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u2014 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\n\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\n\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1983, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77e759f1-bde6-4a1c-87a9-b14400a60077": {"__data__": {"id_": "77e759f1-bde6-4a1c-87a9-b14400a60077", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/marciojunior/code/apps/llamaindex-starter/data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "26bfce95-59d9-4e23-874b-c427f86ef3d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/marciojunior/code/apps/llamaindex-starter/data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-25"}, "hash": "9c4796dac8c55fcbab6b62b3bb31a65a3ba7e769cf60e246f856b5caa4b0ba2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "697ac129-d81c-4b00-ad91-a9c93d00d715", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/marciojunior/code/apps/llamaindex-starter/data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-25"}, "hash": "c6138424b37d36c14438f461db0a29b3eeb6510ac6c2715df17d450899c83725", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa3cb11f-9ad5-43d0-abbc-f7e13de6a0fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8d417673ba8dadb7be73dc07d0533bf0c3aab4206103c59a7ed3bed7d781312", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I was puzzled by the 1401.

In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.

You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.

I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.\n\nToward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall.

The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine.

You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.

Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook.

After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers.

Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away.

It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]\n\nThere were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote.

It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]\n\nThere were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.\n\nThere were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.\n\nWe did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them.

For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts.

Maybe one day we'd have so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.\n\nAnother thing I didn't get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup.

I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.\n\nWhen I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me.

I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me.

That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.\n\nSo I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition.

I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.\n\nAs Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd been talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]\n\nOnce again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.\n\nThere are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.\n\nYC was not organized as a fund.", "start_char_idx": 48870, "end_char_idx": 51027, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f9b8354-d29b-4961-96ce-ae9599fe9b5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f9b8354-d29b-4961-96ce-ae9599fe9b5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/marciojunior/code/apps/llamaindex-starter/data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "26bfce95-59d9-4e23-874b-c427f86ef3d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/marciojunior/code/apps/llamaindex-starter/data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-25"}, "hash": "9c4796dac8c55fcbab6b62b3bb31a65a3ba7e769cf60e246f856b5caa4b0ba2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb524220-9233-4d77-a33c-0fbdc2abaad4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/marciojunior/code/apps/llamaindex-starter/data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-25"}, "hash": "21251c26c185fde4f1d22a37a65201d491d1ebf74b8d0b132c498e36f7490349", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19417883-9d81-448a-a391-3c21c7728a7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0dca92420e393a57e10b1dfe16d7409a3c421d145961f5c779176728d13049b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In those days, those two words didn't go together.

If all I'd had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. [17]\n\nAs well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc.

I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question.

It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.\n\nMcCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way \u2014 indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.\n\nNow they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it.

When you run a forum, you're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it's correct.

So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.\n\n\n\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.", "start_char_idx": 73527, "end_char_idx": 75013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"26bfce95-59d9-4e23-874b-c427f86ef3d1": {"node_ids": ["697ac129-d81c-4b00-ad91-a9c93d00d715", "77e759f1-bde6-4a1c-87a9-b14400a60077", "fa3cb11f-9ad5-43d0-abbc-f7e13de6a0fe", "bbdd5a9b-9cb9-49ca-8a73-7f978b54e4e9", "b71e1d0a-a9e9-418c-ad4f-1f8a5ba9f8b5", "3b385888-8ee6-403d-96ea-41c33ace89ae", "a08502bd-5cb0-42f8-b1b5-0de0dd128453", "4ef33672-5ffa-4bb2-9ec2-cb8a46c658c1", "03c1cc95-ce17-477b-b753-715aa6ef2b6a", "5456050e-c459-44ca-8a9b-e54741504fdd", "19257f61-f304-43ef-9ecf-9c0da81113db", "4a5926fc-b3fd-46bd-b652-6d9fe7c56889", "69a2b1ca-e8b2-4384-a186-fd7c2747981e", "3b69533a-ce9d-477e-abf2-30efef96958f", "73c0d0ca-2164-47c4-924c-efac5dc7ce2a", "5cfb495b-74be-4d3c-88c9-f662b0ec23c3", "0609dc7d-4a98-4ec6-9a3e-bf354b4c7158", "c86d2622-be9a-48cb-bf2f-90db06818a8c", "126bddd6-6577-4f05-8b40-b02a994d510f", "24b10712-31e7-44dc-a955-8908acd30732", "d353d8d1-be41-4e8c-96fd-9a026e6ac2d1", "bb0e9415-b3c4-4fe1-b0eb-b12662220cad", "135d0269-e129-45b9-979f-524cb4544a39", "71a5477e-44e4-42b8-ad65-f961247fe787", "0f690708-0882-49da-89ab-38dd27c48c5d", "dd963244-7c34-41d5-9f23-be4e6aba7626", "11861c8a-4bf1-4af8-adcd-b33f9be60164", "7b030ca3-023e-4df8-873a-cded5aa67bf0", "d17cecb5-5a82-423c-9c5c-21b076b33e7a", "4e17c6be-1af5-4e4b-b31a-8309850ecff6", "4b73f05c-a095-4b58-bfa2-2763c52f8c68", "1440a430-7742-4748-b848-4b9df0c06b61", "feab5689-24cf-4296-9810-915dd4911791", "dd109663-9b02-43ec-a351-cdd32fc475d9", "911be10b-df31-4cae-b70c-62d30d5572db", "022163df-dfac-4dd2-85a7-9f4e68e7bd5a", "b406c6ad-0b62-4256-b429-3d277bec4a89", "1204f801-e4db-4ced-ad05-b60d2efff6fb", "8eeecfea-e0ff-4be8-a889-594cc65a983c", "3769d0b4-9a48-4180-9016-d38c4e4761b4", "cb524220-9233-4d77-a33c-0fbdc2abaad4", "4f9b8354-d29b-4961-96ce-ae9599fe9b5a", "19417883-9d81-448a-a391-3c21c7728a7f", "cffe9f18-9c22-4c00-8c59-87821dbeb859", "3bc1c7c9-c590-4324-887e-f42f0a6d5024", "9bbffcca-86ee-48b0-a3f5-4b7d7303aceb", "95c55a15-3525-43c8-85e2-12e11ffcfb77", "086447af-9e32-46a5-9351-a184836f5df5", "5e3b9870-760d-41d6-b17e-ece945c16a49", "c5a0c4b9-3870-4223-92c9-ebb9133cd789", "4f752449-e252-4141-a651-84eaad271b77", "0f0a86df-4e5f-49e5-a2ad-71af91886119", "3b00b4f0-e920-474b-8aba-38f634dd9d66", "2f708bf7-af31-4a15-ab0e-4b0d9600e311", "d9997ec5-44c4-478d-ba44-4b92220a8627", "58fa2204-68e9-4240-9b31-664915b1b373", "79fd0bb3-2ae0-44e0-9053-d975ff66b1b4", "a034128e-debc-40f7-82af-42ec3b3aedca", "43a7d53c-7e50-4bf4-84b5-80e0ac1bde40", "f4b8d81a-8b0a-4275-9523-cf6a1a0610d3", "bf3f940d-ad09-4794-b387-3e7159a8f0dc"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/marciojunior/code/apps/llamaindex-starter/data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-25"}}}}
